> In order to sync one of your GitBook organizations with a GitHub organization, our GitBook OAuth application needs permissions to access this GitHub organization. Otherwise, it will not be listed.
>
> ### Check the current status {#check-the-current-status}
>
> You can check that the GitBook application is able to access the required GitHub organization by visiting[GitBook's authorization page](https://github.com/settings/connections/applications/e103ee3796d447fab74c).
>
> ### Grant access to GitBook {#grant-access-to-gitbook}
>
> If the GitBook application doesn't have access to the GitHub organization, you can either:
>
> * directly grant the application access to the organization if you are an owner,
> * or make a request to the organization's owner to grant the access.
>
> ### Reconnecting your GitHub account {#reconnecting-your-github-account}
>
> After the access has been granted on GitHub, you must update your GitHub Access Token for the GitBook OAuth application. To do so, simply go to[your settings page](https://www.gitbook.com/settings/github)and click on`Reconnect GitHub Account`.
